    <p>Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car and behind
        the other two are goats. You pick a door, say door number 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors,
        opens another door, say door number 3, and reveals the first goat. He then says to you, <b>"Do you want to stay
            with the
            first door you picked, or would you like to switch and pick door number 2?".</b></p>

    <p>Now most people (including myself once upon a time), would assume that since you're down to two doors, the
        chances of winning are 50/50 regardless of whether you decide to stick with your first choice or switch to
        another door. Believe it or not, this isn't true!

            <h1 class='centerHeader'> The History Behind This Problem </h1>
            <p>
                The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the
                American
                television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The problem was
                originally
                posed in a letter by Steve Selvin in 1990 to Marilyn vos Savant's "Ask Marilyn" column.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vos Savant's response was that the contestant should switch to the other door. She argued that
                contestants
                who
                switch have a 2 in 3 chance of winning the car, while contestants who stick to their initial choice have
                only a
                1 in 3 chance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not convinced? Well you aren't alone. Many readers of vos Savant's column refused to believe switching
                is
                a superior strategy. After the problem appeared in her column, approximately 10,000 readers,
                including nearly 1,000 with PhDs, wrote to the magazine, most of them claiming vos Savant was wrong.
                Paul
                Erd≈ës,
                one of the most prolific mathematicians in history, remained unconvinced until he was shown a computer
                simulation demonstrating vos Savant's predicted result.

            <h1 class='centerHeader'> Understanding the solution conceptually </h1>
            <p>A lot of people struggle understanding how on Earth the odds aren't always 50/50. The key here is that
                you
                are
                NOT
                making a completely 'blind' guess between the two remaining doors. The Monty Hall problem has a very
                specific
                clause: Monty, the host of the show, knows where the car is. He is the one who eliminates one of the
                doors
                that
                you
                did not select. When he eliminates the doors (i.e. shows you what's behind the door you did NOT select)
                he
                never
                chooses the door with the car. Because Monty will never eliminate the door that holds the car, he raises
                the
                odds that switching is always a good bet.</p>
            <p>Now this can be difficult to wrap your head around with only 3 doors, so let's look at the exact same
                problem
                with 100 doors instead of 3. You pick a random door. Instead of one door, Monty now eliminates 98
                doors.These
                are
                doors that he knows do not have the prize! This leaves only two doors. The one you picked, and one that
                was
                left
                after Monty eliminated the others. Do you still feel like sticking with the door you first picked when
                there
                were 100 options is just as likely
                to result in a win than the remaining door that Monty himself made sure stays in the game? </p>

            <h1 class='centerHeader'> Understanding the solution mathematically </h1>

            <p> If you still aren't convinced then another way to understanding the solution is to list out all
                the
                possible
                outcomes, and count how often you get the car if you stay versus switch. Assuming you decide to
                select
                door
                one
                first, then the possible outcomes can be seen in this table:</p>

            <p>In two out of three cases, you win the car by changing your selection after one of the doors is
                revealed.
                Hence,
                by changing your option, you double your probability of winning vs. sticking with the same door.

                Another way of seeing the same set of options is by drawing it out as a decision tree. As you
                can see in
                the
                decision tree, when you switch your door you win 2 out of 3 times versus when you stick with
                your door
                you
                only
                win 1 out of 3 times.
